# DSA_Caprisone_Project
 This is the first project i did in DSA (Incubator Hub) as an evidence of learning for data analysis. I have learnt that logical and critical thinking is very important when analyzing a dataset and also learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL and now to my portfolio building.

## Project Topic: E commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement by analysing the product and customer review data. By carefully analysing this data we seek to gather enough insights to make resonable decision concerning how best to go about marketing strategies and improvement in our products.

### Tools Used
- Ms Excel for data cleaning
  
### Data Cleaning and Prepartion
At the intial phase of the data cleaning and preparation we used the following steps;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Date cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This basically involvedthe exploring of the data to answer some question about the data which includes;
- What is the average discount percentage by product category?
- What is the total number of reviews per category?
- What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
- What is the total potential revenue (actual_price Ã— rating_count) by category?
